# CINS465 Project

For the project in this course you have a website that does the following:

* Uses data in some way
  * Needs to present this data to the user
  * Can get new data from the user or alternative source
  * If data presented to the user has changed they should get updated version without refreshing page
* Uses templates
* Be hosted on the cloud
  * I will be providing you $50 of Google Compute Cloud Credit for this purpose

I will only be supporting development with the technologies discussed in class:

* Django 1.10
* React JS
* Foundations 6

You will be graded on the following:

* Proposal (Due 10/16/16)
  * The proposal should give a basic idea for your project
    * If you are working as a pair, I expect the idea to be more involved than that of a group of one.
  * Proposal should offer a simple idea of what pages your site will provide the user(s)
    * Can be hand drawn, but expect you to have given some thought for how people will interact with your site. 
  * If you are working in a pair how your project how you will break out the tasks for each member
  * A timeline for getting aspects of the project setup, working, developed, etc. 
* Check-In Meeting
  * Partway through the semester you/your group will be required to meet with me to demo your current working state of your project. The purpose of this meeting is to make sure you are making progress.
