# CINS465 Project

For the project in this course you have a website that does the following:

* Uses data in some way
  * Needs to present this data to the user
  * Can get new data from the user or alternative source
  * Ideally if data presented to the user has changed they should get updated version without refreshing page
* Uses templates
* Have a minimum complexity to involve learning something beyond what we cover in class
  * Can not implement the functionality of a blog and/or forum only. 
* Be hosted on the cloud
  * I will be providing you $50 of Google Compute Cloud Credit for this purpose

I will only be supporting development with the technologies discussed in class:

* Django 1.10
* React JS
* Foundations 6

You will be graded on the following:

* Proposal (Due 3/19/17)
  * The proposal should give a basic idea for your project
    * If you want to work in a group of two you will need to come discuss with me prior to the proposal date and present a project with a compelling need for more than one student working on it. If approved you will only need to turn in one proposal for the group.
  * Proposal should offer a simple idea of what pages your site will provide the user(s)
    * Can be hand drawn, but expect you to have given some thought for how people will interact with your site. 
  * If you are were approved to work as a group of two, you will need to break out the tasks for each member
  * A timeline for getting aspects of the project setup, working, developed, etc. 
  * Goals for the project
    * Can think of these as components of your web project you hope to have working by the end of the semester.
    * You should also include stretch goals or goals you have for the project if time allows or that you would like to add possibly after the semester. 
  * Submitting Proposal: Please email me a pdf or word document with the above details as different sections. You can submit your proposal up until the day it is due and if I can get you feedback you will lose no points. Having issues with your proposal after the due date will lose points. 
* Check-In Meeting
  * Partway through the semester you/your group will be required to meet with me to demo your current working state of your project. The purpose of this meeting is to make sure you are making progress.
* Project Presentation
  * Near the end of the semester and likely the day of the final we will have presentations of your project, which you will be graded on how well you can present your project, what goals it had, what you have working at the time of the presentation, and technical problems you've run into along the way.
* Project
  * Your project will be graded on the following:
    * If it meets your goals
    * How easy it is for me to use
    * If it meets the requirements
  * Submit your project through a github repo, make sure I'm a collaborator if it's not a repo I created for you.
* Feedback
  * You'll get a Google Survey after the semester ends that you will need to fill out, this will include pair feedback if you were approved to work in a group of two. It also will ask for feedback on the project, class, and things you think should be clarified, improved, etc for future semesters.
